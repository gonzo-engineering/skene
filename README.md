# Skene

Part of the [Gonzo Engineering](https://gonzo.engineering) project, Skene is a collection of tools and templates intended to empower musicians to create unique, independent online presences.

Currently powering:

- [thomasashby.co.uk](https://thomasashby.co.uk)
- [boness.art](https://boness.art)

More to come, hopefully.

## Why?

Maintaining a website takes time and money, both of which most musicians would rather be spending on their music. Third party platforms offer limited control, and some subscriptions can amount to hefty sums over time.  

The idea with Skene that if essential info - artist details, releases, lyrics, gigs, etc. - is turned into data, that data can be used to generate rich, immersive websites, giving artists fully customisable spaces of their own on the web.

Think the [Neil Young Archives](https://neilyoungarchives.com/), but for everyone.

## Auth

Skene is (currently) set up to use Netlify Identity so artists can log in and update their information. To set this up you need to enable it in the Netlify account that's deploying the site, enable Git Gateway, and invite whatever email addresses should have access.
