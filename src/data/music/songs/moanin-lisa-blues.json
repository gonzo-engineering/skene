Keep it down!\n\nAlthough I'm only eight years old,\n\nI've really paid my dues, it's true.\n\nThat's why I've got a case of,\n\nA case of the Moanin' Lisa Blues.\n\nI wonder how I got here,\n\nI wonder what I'll be.\n\nThe saddest little twig\n\nOn this crazy family tree.\n\nI feel like I'm a loser,\n\nWith nothing left to lose.\n\nThat's why I've got a case of,\n\nA case of the Moanin' Lisa Blues.\n\nOh there's just no postponing,\n\nA case of the Moanin' Lisa Blues."
