I've got a bratty brother,

Who bugs me every day.

This morning my old mother,

Gave my last cupcake away.

My dad he acts like,

Like he belongs in the zoo.

I'm the saddest kid,

The saddest kid in Grade number two.



I wish I had a pony,

I wish I were eighteen,

I wish I had a dime

For every kid who treats me mean.

They tease me 'cause I'm diff'rent,

Little diff'rent from the rest, oh yes.

Well, I'm down so low,

If I cheered up, I'd still be depressed.



The saxophone's my best friend,

I play all over town.

But when I practice in my room, I hear

Lisa! Keep it down!

Although I'm only eight years old,

I've really paid my dues, it's true.

That's why I've got a case of,

A case of the Moanin' Lisa Blues.



I wonder how I got here,

I wonder what I'll be.

The saddest little twig

On this crazy family tree.

I feel like I'm a loser,

With nothing left to lose.

That's why I've got a case of,

A case of the Moanin' Lisa Blues.



Oh there's just no postponing,

A case of the Moanin' Lisa Blues.
